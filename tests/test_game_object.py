#is_inside  (mind edge case of the point being on the line)
#line_intersect (test required precision, test if no interesction, test not normalized direction)
#move_object     (test new position, test rotation, test rotation angle with different conventions (larger than pi, -pi))
#shortest_distance (test distance inside,test distance outside, test point on object border, )


# Test validity of object hierachy
